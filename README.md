# Contact Allergies

This is the repository for [Contact Allergies](https://contactallergies.com). A site I created to help me keep track of resources related to my contact allergies. If you want to improve it or add more information, please open an issue or a pull request!

### Installing

This is a [Jekyll]() site, and is developed similarly to other jekyll sites. In order to run it, you need to install ruby, install the gems, and run 'bundle exec jekyll serve'
